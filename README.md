# Ender-3-Pro-Electronics-Enclosure
Build guide and BOM for converting standard Ender 3 Pro printers to a Voron-inspired electronics enclosure.

This guide is for converting our custom Ender 3 Pro printers (standard bed) to have a Voron-inspired electronics enclosure. The print files are saved on the server, but the original project can be found here for reference:
https://www.printables.com/model/385532-ender-3-pro-voron-themed-electronics-enclosure/comments

The original project doesn’t have very clear instructions, so we’ve written up our own process for utilizing the printed parts. Some of the files have been edited for use with our specific layout, so **download all print files from the server, not the original project.**

See the parts lists below to gather and print everything you'll need for the upgrade before you get started.

# Step by Step Instructions
1. Remove all zipties holding cables to the lower frame and lay the printer on its side
2. Unscrew the PSU from the frame, then remove the mainboard enclosure and screen/Raspberry Pi
3. Remove the plastic base from the PSU. You will have to disconnect the wires from the mainboard to feed them back through the hole.
4. Take the plug adapter off of the plastic base. Break off and sand down the bottom "wing" to make it fit on the grill. Mount the plug adapter to the 'Back Grill Middle' using one M3x16 screww and T nut. The T nut will just span the hexagon space that the screw passes through.
5. Add the heat press inserts to the holes indicated below in the grill panels

# Additional Build Notes
- Wire lengths will need to be adjusted once everything is rearranged.
- The screen panel and screen will be completely removed from the printer after this upgrade.
