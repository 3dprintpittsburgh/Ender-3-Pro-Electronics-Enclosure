# Ender-3-Pro-Electronics-Enclosure
Build guide and BOM for converting standard Ender 3 Pro printers to a Voron-inspired electronics enclosure.

This guide is for converting our custom Ender 3 Pro printers (standard bed) to have a Voron-inspired electronics enclosure. The print files are saved on the server, but the original project can be found here for reference:

The original project doesn’t have very clear instructions, so we’ve written up our own process for utilizing the printed parts. Some of the files have been edited for use with our specific layout, so # download all print files from the server, not the original project.
